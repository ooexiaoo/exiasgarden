These are my personal notes that I've made while learning HTML & CSS. These might not be helpful for a newbie as I only wrote the things that I was finding difficult at the time and wanted to learn better.

You can find all the code that I've written in the notes as well, If you'd ever want to make similar things.

All the code is written is VSC. More on that in another post.
