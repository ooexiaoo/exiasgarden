## MOCs
**Maps Of Contents** or **MOCs** are nothing more than a dashboard on a specific topic. They are there to provide an easy way to access and absorb any content on the site.

## Fleeting Notes
Fleeting notes are ideas that are captured in a quick and easy to digest format. These are not complete ideas and are often nothing more than a few points. These can be mostly be found in **level 64**.

## Level 64
A page where I keep all my fleeting notes, "A work in progress" This is the place where my incomplete ideas and notes are stored. I keep them here, so anyone can see them to an idea of what I might be writing about.

## Literature Notes
Literature notes are to help me record ideas and information from various sources, these can be books, articles, podcasts, YouTube, etc.

## Reference Notes
Reference notes are used to record and track reference information. These also act like Wikipedia at times.

## Permanent Notes
Permanent notes are notes that are processed ideas. These are notes that I've edited enough that they can explain the ideas on their own, they are completed notes.

## Project Notes
For documenting and processing ideas for a specific project. I use project notes.
