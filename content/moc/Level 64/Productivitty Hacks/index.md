## 1. Use A Calender
Use calendar and time block to make sure you are doing what you're supposed to be doing, this also helps with reminders.

## 2. Create A **"Might-Do List"** Of Daily Tasks
These are the potential things I can do in the day.

Also add on **"Highlight of the day"** task. This is the most important task of the day, if this is done the day can be considered a success.

## 3. Zettelkastan Note Taking System
The kind I'm using now. Use this to make notes and connect them together. This improves creativity and also helps keep all the notes in one place.

You can customize it as you wish.

This can also be used as a **"morning dump"** where you write down all the things that are in your mind. Like a dairy.

You can also use a [PKM](https://exiasgarden.pages.dev/posts/what-is-a-pkm/) for taking notes in a Zettelkastan form.

## 4. Store All The Things In One Place
Like google drive, which can help you find everything in terms of data that you'd need on day-to-day basis in one place.

This helps reduce time for searching for things, especially if you've segregated things properly from the beginning.

Create a vault with with all your data preformatted, so you can access and update it on a daily basis without putting in a lot of work.
