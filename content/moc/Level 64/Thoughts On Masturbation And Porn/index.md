## How watching porn can rewire our brain
1. Having the option to see many women in that position where your primal mind sees them as a sexual partner is something we didn't have a few decades also.
2. The option to fast-forward, click to another tab and have endless option of items to see and get excited from create a huge problem when it comes to how we see sex as a whole.
3. Watching porn in itself is a very weird thing because we mostly see a woman and a man having sex and we as a viewer are just sitting here enjoying what they are doing to each other. Of course, we imagine being the partner, So if I'm a man, ill imagine me having sex with the girl I see on the screen instead of that male porn star.
4. Porn is also responsible for setting unrealistic expectations from our own sex life. Do you really think you can have the kind of banging, perfect sex that you see online? People with perfect bodies in the perfect setting. It's unrealistic in every standard.
	1. We watch all these and try to copy it all. It's not a bad thing to get inspired by it by expecting the same kind of excitement can be a very wrong approach.

## Masturbation Is A Healthy Activity, But How Much Do You Need It?
So to understand why we masturbate and is it necessary, is a complex thing and will need more explaining here -

### How much can you control your urge to masturbate?
1. Depending on the person, we all have a different level of control. Some are excellent at controlling their urges, some but are not.
This can also get really complicated, but to keep things simple. *Everyone has different levels of susceptibility to different matters. One might be superb at controlling their urges when it comes to masturbation, but won't be able to control their cravings towards food and vice-a-versa.*
2. How you build up your own ability to control yourself is also important, without being addicted to porn or masturbation.
3. I'm not advocating for **no fap**, There are benefits to masturbation that should be considered. 

### How long will you keep doing this with yourself?
1. Till what age would you consider masturbating? I get it that after marriage that number will go down by a lot, but the question still remains. Till what age would you keep wanting to have sex or wanting to be lustful?
2. There should be a mental limit to how much you want to expose yourself to sex. The further you dive into it, the harder it'll be to get out of it. We have seen people in history falling for this thing, unable to control themselves. *Asking yourself, would it be OK to live a life where you give sex such an importance be a good thing?*

## How much mental space are you ready to give to sex & porn?
1. As a person gets older, I think it's important that they withdraw all the attention from porn and sex.
2. What's a valid reason you should keep thinking about it even when you're old? You can't really make babies! Even if you can, do you really think it's a practical proposition?
3. My personal belief is that with time we should try to withdraw from the material world, Especially in old age. There is no benefit in staying connected to things when you're on the doorstep of death. Your mind and soul will have a hard time being liberated if you're on that stage and still thinking about petty things like porn and sex.
4. Even if you're not old, is it worth it to give sex so much space in your head. Is it rational to make your decisions based on these things, or is it rational to think about these things when they are not beneficial to you? The question is where do you draw the line between a healthy sexual habit vs a mind that gives too much attention to sex?

Here is a hierarchy of watching porn that one can use to go from watching porn videos to watching nothing at all.
### Watching porn Vs Seeing a pictures Vs not seeing anything
#### Watching Porn
1. In HD quality, you can skip to the right moment in the video. You can have virtually unlimited options.
2. The worst thing you can do for yourself. You don't even have to think while masturbating to porn. You get to see everything in every genre that you every desire.

#### Seeing A Picture
1. Depending on where are you seeing these pictures, you can still have unlimited options.
2. What you can't have is seeing the ability to see things moving, you have to actively imagine having sex. This is way better than videos because you're not just mindlessly seeing things.

#### Not Seeing Anything
1. Not having anything to see is I think the best thing one can do if they are used to watching porn.
2. You have to actively imagine everything. It's not easy if you're used to mindlessly watching porn.
3. This is something that people from a few centuries ago were doing, as they did not even have pictures.
4. Among the three, this can be the healthiest thing to do as you do not have any options like seeing other picture, or seeing the object of your excitement moving. If you have to change the person in your imagination, you have to imagine it.
