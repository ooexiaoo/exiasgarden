Jordan Peterson says that in order to think well its best to learn to write. When you can organize your thoughts well on a paper (or in this any digital format like this one) it helps you see things better in your head. And he is not the first one to say this I think.

I remember writing something similar when I was writing a post on insightfulsage.com. It said something similar, that organzing your thoughts on a paper helps you see them clearly. It helps take away the jumbled mess that's in your head and helps you to sort them out properly.

I use to write but then I had no reason to because what will you write about everyday? there has to be something to add in order to write, but I think that's just me being lazy. There are always things that I can add, There is always a better input and to top it off it can become a practice to not only form a habit but also get better at writing.
