**Master the ability to listen and understand.**

{{<alert>}}As a man who is evolved to fix & solve problems. It becomes a habit to listen to someone’s problems and try to find quick solutions but this is not always the right thing to do. Sometimes people especially, women who are evolved to share their problems and communicate things with each other, Always trying to find a solution or fixing the issues is not the agenda.{{</alert>}}

It is important to understand the intention behind why someone is saying something and approach it in a way that they can reciprocate. Often we fail to see things from their perspective which can create gaps in the relationship. This issue if not fixed in time can create problems between the two.

If you want to make a relationship work, no matter which one it is! Learn to communicate and understand the person. Listening and paying attention to the words can give you all the information needed to make a relationship better. *(not all relationships need to be better if you have some toxic people around you do not apply this advice for them, although you can get a better insight if you focus on them as well.)*

Communicating can become complicated very quickly with things like, understanding one’s perspective, asking the right questions to follow up, talking in a way that they understand you without any miscommunications, etc.

Communicating properly can be a very complex thing as one size fits all doesn’t work here, Different people have different behaviors so understanding one’s needs can be a trial and error but, there is always a proper way to approach someone. This is why listening and being open to communicating is one of the foundational skills needed to be better in life.

Most times communication is a two-way street. If one person is trying to understand and listen while another person is not reciprocating, that can also create miscommunication, as it’s just one guy trying to do all the work. In this case, try to make the person you're talking to understand exactly what you're expecting and how the both of you can approach this in a way where both of you can express yourselves properly.
