1.  Often times we consider ourselves as an understanding person. Although how true this can be depends on person-to-person. There are times that even an understanding person might not be able to understand somethings.
2.  A person can be very oblivious to some aspects even though they might be very well in others. This can affect relationships if not taken care of properly.
3.  We often make the perception that if a person didn't understand it the first time, they might not understand it ever again. So we never try or bother to make them understand that thing.
4.  This can lead to cracks in a relationship, which can have a detrimental impact depending on the seriousness of the situation.
5.  It's important to make them understand how important that particular thing is for you. For them to be able to understand.
6.  Relationships grow with effort and care. Not trying to understand certain aspects of it can be irresponsible and can be considered careless.
