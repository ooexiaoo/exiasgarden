1. The pygmalion effect is a phenomena in which higher beliefs lead to higher performance.
2. The pygmalion effect can be best understood by a circle.
	1. Our beliefs about other person influences our actions towards that person.
	2. Now this action has an impact on others beliefs about themselves.
	3. As others believes change it causes their actions to change.
	4. These actions again reinforce our believes about other person. which repeats the cycle.

Imagine if I tell a girl that she is beautiful **because I believe so**, this will **affect her belief** and will help her take her beauty more seriously. She might start wearing more fashionable clothes, or start using makeup, etc.

Her changes will **renforce my believes** about her that she is beautiful and which **repeat the cycle**.

**The opposite can also be true.**

It's important to note that we usually don't believe what someone says quickly, unless it's more than a few people telling us the same things.
