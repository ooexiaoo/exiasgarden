### Do humans need to create a standard for compassion and empathy
1. We as humans are getting smarter with time but as all we do is get intelligence that doesn't mean that are getting equally compassionate or moral.
2. Going into the future with just intelligence is like shooting a gun but unable to see anything. It can lead to many disasters as people put their own self interests and wants before anything else.
3. This is something I was thinking about that we almost have standard education system. Soon in the coming decades it'll get even better but, we do not have anything close to having a standard moral system that is similar from one place to another.
4. We do try to teach about morals and compassion, but how well we do it as a human society? One household moral code might be completely different from another family down the road.
5. I understand that this is almost impossible to implement looking at the world now but, isn't this something we as humans should be more focused on.
6. For this to happen which is what makes it impossible is to have similar socioeconomic environment to a certain degree. Having no religious constrains will also be an extremely important thing.
7. The other thing that'll be really important for implementing this is to develop critical thinking among the people at a very young age.
8. Having the ability to understand fallacies and biases would be the key to challenging and tackling them in time.
