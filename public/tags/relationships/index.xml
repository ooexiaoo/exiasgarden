      <description>Like compound interest in financial market and money we can also get compound interest/benefits in our relationships. Imagine investing in a good relationship for a long time, this relationship will give you more benefits than if you were to start that relationship and break it in between then start it again and do the same thing. With time relationships have the potential to grow at an exponential rate. It depends on how one manages the relationship.</description>
