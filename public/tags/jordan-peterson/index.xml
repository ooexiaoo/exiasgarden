      <description>Jordan Peterson says that in order to think well its best to learn to write. When you can organize your thoughts well on a paper (or in this any digital format like this one) it helps you see things better in your head. And he is not the first one to say this I think.
I remember writing something similar when I was writing a post on insightfulsage.com. It said something similar, that organzing your thoughts on a paper helps you see them clearly.</description>
