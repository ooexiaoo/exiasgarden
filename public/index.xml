Fleeting Notes&gt; Fleeting Notes # Fleeting notes are ideas that are captured in a quick and easy to digest format. These are not complete ideas and are often nothing more than a few points. These can be mostly be found in level 64.</description>

      <description>A function is a block of code that&amp;rsquo;s named, you can use that name or a variable that points to that function.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not writing the code inside a function, then you&amp;rsquo;re writing the code inside the global scope, which is pretty limited. Most of the code that you write, you&amp;rsquo;d want them to be reusable within functions.
Function Basics&gt; Function Basics # One way to look at functions is that a function is a block of code with a name and because it has a name you can call it over and over.</description>

      <description>We all are taught, &amp;ldquo;Live a life, where you don&amp;rsquo;t have any regrets&amp;rdquo;, You subscribe to the idea and think &amp;ldquo;OK, I&amp;rsquo;ll live a life, where I don&amp;rsquo;t have any regrets!&amp;rdquo;, This sounds great from a macro perspective, but once you start to look at things from a microscopic level you start to see how difficult and punishing this kind of mindset can be.
Just to be clear, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be talking about the obvious things one must do to avoid regrets.</description>

      <description>Ref Link - https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-getting-started
In JavaScript, sometimes we have to conditionally execute some code blocks, but if the condition is not fulfilled we don&amp;rsquo;t.
We do this by adding if statement and in parentheses we put the conditions (5 === 5) if the condition is true we execute the code block, in this case it&amp;rsquo;s the code in the parentheses {}.
In the example below, we are working with numbers, but in most cases we&amp;rsquo;ll be working with variables as shown in the second example.</description>

      <description>Matrix&gt; Matrix # https://ooexiaoo.github.io/Matrix/ Is a cyperpunk style webpage and I added some images and created a projects section as well for this.
Waifu-Walls&gt; Waifu-Walls # https://ooexiaoo.github.io/Waifu-Walls/ Attempted to create a neomorphic and glassmorphic design, didn&amp;rsquo;t turn out to be too good, but is a good experience to make this design. The webpage doesn&amp;rsquo;t do anything, it&amp;rsquo;s more of a design practice.
Personal-site-trial&gt; Personal-site-trial # https://ooexiaoo.github.io/personal-site-trial/ I really wanted to try neomorphism design, so spent a few days writing some code for this one.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a bit of an intro. The reason I uninstalled all my social media apps was with the realization that I might be too addicted to using these apps on a daily basis. The problem with any kind of addiction is that you don&amp;rsquo;t realize that you&amp;rsquo;re addicted. You&amp;rsquo;d see examples of these everywhere. Ask a chain smoker if they can stop smoking? And the answer will be something like, &amp;ldquo;I can stop whenever I want, it&amp;rsquo;s just that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to stop yet!</description>

      <title>What Is A PKM And Why Should You Care</title>

      <guid>https://exiasgarden.pages.dev/posts/what-is-a-pkm/</guid>
      <description>PKM in its full form is known as personal knowledge management, is a system which helps you keep a database of all the knowledge that is important to you in your life. We all have the same problem, which is remembering things that help us make sense of the world.
You can use a PKM for anything that you&amp;rsquo;re into, like when you&amp;rsquo;re working on your PhD, or just want to remember what shows you watched or want to watch, or you stumbled upon a topic and don&amp;rsquo;t want to forget everything that you&amp;rsquo;ve learned by next week, or maybe you just want to track your habits, your workouts or your dreams and goals over time, or maybe you want to remember and cherish all the memories of your loved ones, or just and to remember how you&amp;rsquo;ve lived a good life.</description>

      <title>✍🏻 Learn To Write</title>

      <description>Jordan Peterson says that in order to think well its best to learn to write. When you can organize your thoughts well on a paper (or in this any digital format like this one) it helps you see things better in your head. And he is not the first one to say this I think.
I remember writing something similar when I was writing a post on insightfulsage.com. It said something similar, that organzing your thoughts on a paper helps you see them clearly.</description>

      <description>The effects of watching porn is already discussed in one of my previous notes Thoughts On Masturbation And Porn. So in this one we&amp;rsquo;ll just focus on what changes when we don&amp;rsquo;t watch porn.
It Has No Net Positive&gt; It Has No Net Positive # Porn overall has no real purpose in your life. We have gotten used to porn in recent years just because we now have the access to it, with fast internet and way too much porn content that&amp;rsquo;s produced on a daily basis.</description>

      <description>Friends and family are the most important part of my life, like for many others. I cannot imagine my life without these people. Although it&amp;rsquo;s hard to explain what they mean to me or how friends and family can give your life meaning but, Here&amp;rsquo;s what I have. I might not be able to formulate all my thoughts properly, So I might add another post in the future.

Ad Hominem arguments are often used in politics, where they are often called &amp;ldquo;mudslinging&amp;rdquo;.
People utilize ad hominem fallacy because they want to appeal to people&amp;rsquo;s emotions.

Going into the future with just intelligence is like shooting a gun but unable to see anything. It can lead to many disasters as people put their own self interests and wants before anything else.</description>

      <description>Your actions precede emotion and your emotions precede action.
It just depends on which one you are focusing on at the moment. Sometimes life shows you your flaws, and it does it very brutally.
You need to understand though, that blaming life or anything else won&amp;rsquo;t help you, the only thing that&amp;rsquo;ll help you is learning what it&amp;rsquo;s trying to teach you. There is a jewel in everyone, it&amp;rsquo;s rare to see it shine but it&amp;rsquo;s always amazing to see when you do see it shine.</description>

      <title>Selective Understanding Flaws Of Humans</title>

      <description>Often times we consider ourselves as an understanding person. Although how true this can be depends on person-to-person. There are times that even an understanding person might not be able to understand somethings. A person can be very oblivious to some aspects even though they might be very well in others. This can affect relationships if not taken care of properly. We often make the perception that if a person didn&amp;rsquo;t understand it the first time, they might not understand it ever again.</description>

      <description>The pygmalion effect is a phenomena in which higher beliefs lead to higher performance. The pygmalion effect can be best understood by a circle. Our beliefs about other person influences our actions towards that person. Now this action has an impact on others beliefs about themselves. As others believes change it causes their actions to change. These actions again reinforce our believes about other person. which repeats the cycle. Imagine if I tell a girl that she is beautiful because I believe so, this will affect her belief and will help her take her beauty more seriously.</description>

      <description>Like compound interest in financial market and money we can also get compound interest/benefits in our relationships. Imagine investing in a good relationship for a long time, this relationship will give you more benefits than if you were to start that relationship and break it in between then start it again and do the same thing. With time relationships have the potential to grow at an exponential rate. It depends on how one manages the relationship.</description>
