      <description>We all are taught, &amp;ldquo;Live a life, where you don&amp;rsquo;t have any regrets&amp;rdquo;, You subscribe to the idea and think &amp;ldquo;OK, I&amp;rsquo;ll live a life, where I don&amp;rsquo;t have any regrets!&amp;rdquo;, This sounds great from a macro perspective, but once you start to look at things from a microscopic level you start to see how difficult and punishing this kind of mindset can be.
Just to be clear, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be talking about the obvious things one must do to avoid regrets.</description>

      <description>Jordan Peterson says that in order to think well its best to learn to write. When you can organize your thoughts well on a paper (or in this any digital format like this one) it helps you see things better in your head. And he is not the first one to say this I think.
I remember writing something similar when I was writing a post on insightfulsage.com. It said something similar, that organzing your thoughts on a paper helps you see them clearly.</description>

      <description>Friends and family are the most important part of my life, like for many others. I cannot imagine my life without these people. Although it&amp;rsquo;s hard to explain what they mean to me or how friends and family can give your life meaning but, Here&amp;rsquo;s what I have. I might not be able to formulate all my thoughts properly, So I might add another post in the future.
They Love Me For Who I&amp;rsquo;m&gt; They Love Me For Who I&amp;rsquo;m # Friends and family love you for who you are.</description>

      <description>Who Is A Friend?&gt; Who Is A Friend? # It can be easy and hard to define what friendship is depending on who you&amp;rsquo;re talking to, but as I&amp;rsquo;m getting older the more I look into it, the better I feel about the friends that I have in my life.
So who is a friend? A friend can be anyone, even a family member, if they fulfil some of these roles -</description>
