      <description>What is the Dunning-Kruger Effect?&gt; What is the Dunning-Kruger Effect? # The Dunning-Kruger effect effect occurs when a person’s lack of knowledge and skills in a certain area cause them to overestimate their own competence.

      <description>An ad hominem fallacy uses personal attacks rather than logic. This fallacy occurs when someone rejects or criticizes another point of view based on the personal characteristics, ethnic background, physical appearance, or other non-relevant traits of the person who holds it.
Ad Hominem arguments are often used in politics, where they are often called &amp;ldquo;mudslinging&amp;rdquo;.
People utilize ad hominem fallacy because they want to appeal to people&amp;rsquo;s emotions.

      <description>Often times we consider ourselves as an understanding person. Although how true this can be depends on person-to-person. There are times that even an understanding person might not be able to understand somethings. A person can be very oblivious to some aspects even though they might be very well in others. This can affect relationships if not taken care of properly. We often make the perception that if a person didn&amp;rsquo;t understand it the first time, they might not understand it ever again.</description>

      <description>The pygmalion effect is a phenomena in which higher beliefs lead to higher performance. The pygmalion effect can be best understood by a circle. Our beliefs about other person influences our actions towards that person. Now this action has an impact on others beliefs about themselves. As others believes change it causes their actions to change. These actions again reinforce our believes about other person. which repeats the cycle. Imagine if I tell a girl that she is beautiful because I believe so, this will affect her belief and will help her take her beauty more seriously.</description>
