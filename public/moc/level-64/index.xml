      <description>Jordan Peterson says that in order to think well its best to learn to write. When you can organize your thoughts well on a paper (or in this any digital format like this one) it helps you see things better in your head. And he is not the first one to say this I think.
I remember writing something similar when I was writing a post on insightfulsage.com. It said something similar, that organzing your thoughts on a paper helps you see them clearly.</description>

      <description>The effects of watching porn is already discussed in one of my previous notes Thoughts On Masturbation And Porn. So in this one we&amp;rsquo;ll just focus on what changes when we don&amp;rsquo;t watch porn.
It Has No Net Positive&gt; It Has No Net Positive # Porn overall has no real purpose in your life. We have gotten used to porn in recent years just because we now have the access to it, with fast internet and way too much porn content that&amp;rsquo;s produced on a daily basis.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a beauty inside all of us, although we may not see it all the time but, there are times when we see a glimpse of this beauty.
It can be a strangers smile, It can be a gesture, it can be anything that gives us a window to see into the souls of others.
Yesterday I saw a blind girl walking down the street, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what she was thinking but was just smiling.</description>

      <description>Master the ability to listen and understand.
As a man who is evolved to fix &amp;amp; solve problems. It becomes a habit to listen to someone‚Äôs problems and try to find quick solutions but this is not always the right thing to do.

      <description>Do humans need to create a standard for compassion and empathy&gt; Do humans need to create a standard for compassion and empathy # We as humans are getting smarter with time but as all we do is get intelligence that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that are getting equally compassionate or moral. Going into the future with just intelligence is like shooting a gun but unable to see anything. It can lead to many disasters as people put their own self interests and wants before anything else.</description>

      <description>How watching porn can rewire our brain&gt; How watching porn can rewire our brain # Having the option to see many women in that position where your primal mind sees them as a sexual partner is something we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a few decades also. The option to fast-forward, click to another tab and have endless option of items to see and get excited from create a huge problem when it comes to how we see sex as a whole.</description>

      <description>Often times we consider ourselves as an understanding person. Although how true this can be depends on person-to-person. There are times that even an understanding person might not be able to understand somethings. A person can be very oblivious to some aspects even though they might be very well in others. This can affect relationships if not taken care of properly. We often make the perception that if a person didn&amp;rsquo;t understand it the first time, they might not understand it ever again.</description>

      <description>Like compound interest in financial market and money we can also get compound interest/benefits in our relationships. Imagine investing in a good relationship for a long time, this relationship will give you more benefits than if you were to start that relationship and break it in between then start it again and do the same thing. With time relationships have the potential to grow at an exponential rate. It depends on how one manages the relationship.</description>
